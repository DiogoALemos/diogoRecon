# diogoRecon
REQUIRED install.sh to be used before this script can be used correctly
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RedRecon is a tool for recon and vunerability scan on selected target using Dnsx, Sublist3r, Amass, DnsRecon, Haktrails, Notify and Dirsearch , by inputting the address we wish to scan it automaticly uses the 7 tools via automated usage afther the first input saving it in a created folder called Relat√≥rios the output of the programs will be located in that directory, The program can further be modified to use new commands already existing in the previous 7 tools or to reduce the amount of searches haktrail will perform so the API key doesnt get exhausted quickly since its currently running 3 intructions so depending on where its going to be used its better to remove 1 or 2 lines of hatrails
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE run the script and input the target via the input requested by the script
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING with haktrails a API key is needed for it to work otherwise it will not function, it uses alot of tokens so spend them wisely
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of the script running ( only 2 tools are being shown out of the 7 that run automatically )
